# Hardcode 2013 - Vulnerability Reward Program #

As part of [Hardcode](Hardcode2013ContestDescription.md), we are inviting security researchers to participate in a bug bounty program to look for vulnerabilities in the five finalist applications of the competition.

The finalists were chosen because of the number and complexity of the features implemented and their security relative to their functionality and that of the other applications.

We will give out bounties from **$50.00** to **$100.00 USD** per unique vulnerability up to a total of **$3,000.00 USD**.

Please consider that we will only reward the first report of a vulnerability, and several vulnerabilities might have already been found by the judging panel.

To participate in this vulnerability reward program, you need to abide by the following rules:
  * Do not perform Denial of Service attacks, this includes:
    * No defacing, or perform any scripts that makes the application unusable.
    * No flooding the applications with automated requests.
    * No XSS scripts which lock the browser.
    * If you wish to run an automated scanner, deploy your own version of the application, do not use automated scanners on the live applications as doing so, or anything that might be disruptive to others might get the IP banned and you might not be eligible for a reward anymore.
  * Bugcrowd will be administering the bug bounty and will award 10 Bugcrowd points to the first to report each valid vulnerability. 5 points will be rewarded to all other valid vulnerabilities.
  * For the best bug found on each application, the finder will receive a bonus of **$100.00 USD** on top of the usual reward and 10 bonus points for the best finding for each app.
  * There's a maximum budget of **$500.00 USD** per application (plus the **$100.00 USD** bonus for the best bug), if the budget is reached for a given application, we will update it here, and it will be out of scope of the program.

The list of applications in scope are:
  * **0xC0DEBA5E**
    * Test application: https://0xc0deba5e.hardcodecontest.com/
    * Source Code: https://code.google.com/p/0xc0deba5e/source/browse/
  * **Appdaptor**
    * Test application: https://appdaptor.hardcodecontest.com/
    * Source Code: https://code.google.com/p/appdaptor-project/downloads/list
  * **CeciliaSec**
    * Test application: https://ceciliasec.hardcodecontest.com/
    * Source Code: https://code.google.com/p/ceciliasec/source/browse/
  * **Gridlock**
    * Test application: https://gridlock.hardcodecontest.com/
    * Source Code: https://code.google.com/p/gridlock-exchange/source/browse/
  * **DesiCoders** `[1]`
    * Test application: https://desicoders.hardcodecontest.com/
    * Source Code: https://code.google.com/p/campusbuzz/source/browse/

Finally, you can use [this form](http://bugcrowd.com/google/) to report vulnerabilities you find in the applications.
